// Looking at the DynTables, variable 'x' has a Struct type 'A' which needs
// some fields; at least: "{ B C -> D }" and "@{ v=C; ...}", and may have more
// fields.  The field offsets can be resolved once this function is called.
// See testOver14.aa
// Type: { [[  D3: _ in { - A -> B }, A10: C, D8: _ in *[]@{ v=A;  ..., }]] _ -> B }
